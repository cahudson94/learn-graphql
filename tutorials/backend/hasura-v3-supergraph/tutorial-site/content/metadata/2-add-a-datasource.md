Hasura can connect to a variety of data sources. We understand that your data is likely spread across multiple sources
with various owners and in a number of different formats. We want to make it easy for you to access all of your data
from a single GraphQL API. We call this concept the [**data supergraph**](https://hasura.io/supergraph).

## Data Connectors {#data-connectors}

To connect to data sources, Hasura utilizes [**data connectors**](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/connectors/introduction/).
A data connector is an HTTP service that exposes a set of APIs which Hasura uses to communicate with the data source.
The data connector is responsible for interpreting work to be done on behalf of the Hasura Engine, using the native
query language of the data source.

Data connectors are available for a number of data sources, including PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Qdrant, and more. You can
learn more about them on the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors).

In this guide, we'll be using the `hasura/postgres` data connector to connect to a PostgreSQL database.

## Connect to your data source {#connect-to-your-data-source}

The Hasura CLI makes it easy to connect to your data source. You can use the `metadata add-hub-connector` command to
connect to a data source from the connector hub.

When you run the command below, the CLI will generate a `.env` file in your project's root directory with the connection
string for your data source. It will then create a new subdirectory in the `default` subgraph's `dataconnectors`
directory with the connection information in a file named after the value you pass immediately after the
`add-hub-connector` command (`pg_db` in the example below):

```bash
hasura3 metadata add-hub-connector pg_db --dir . --subgraph default --id hasura/postgres --url <DATABASE_URL>
```

We're passing a few flags to this command:

- `--dir .` tells the CLI to use the current directory as the project directory.
- `--subgraph default` tells the CLI to add the data source to the default
  [subgraph](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/ci-cd/subgraphs/).
- `--id hasura/postgres` tells the CLI to use the `hasura/postgres` connector from the connector hub.

### Hosted data sources {#hosted-data-sources}

If your database is hosted on a cloud provider, you can connect to it by copying your connection string which should
look like this:

```text
postgresql://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE_NAME>
```

### Local data sources {#local-data-sources}

If you want to connect a local database for development, you can use the new Hasura CLI to create a local daemon and
securely connect to your database. We call this a **Secure Connect** tunnel. Tunnels are beneficial because they allow
you to connect your local database to your Hasura project on Hasura DDN without exposing it to the internet.

#### Start your database

Start your local database. For example, if you are using Docker, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name <DATABASE_NAME> -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<YOUR_PASSWORD> -p 5432:5432 <DATABASE_IMAGE>
```

#### Start the daemon

Start the Hasura daemon with the `daemon start` command:

```bash
hasura3 daemon start
```

The daemon will block this window while it runs.

#### Create a Secure Connect tunnel

Open a new tab or window for your terminal and run the `create` command:

```bash
hasura3 tunnel create <SOCKET>
```

The `<SOCKET>` argument is the address of your local database. For example, if you are running a local PostgreSQL
database on the default port, you would use `localhost:5432`.

The CLI will return a URL that you can use to connect to your database. You should use this URL to form a connection
string for your database, like this:

```text
postgresql://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<URL_RETURNED_BY_THE_CLI>/<DATABASE_NAME>
```

## Secrets

Optionally, you can utilize **secrets** to store your connection strings. Secrets are a new concept in Hasura that allow
you to store sensitive information securely. You can quickly create them
[using the CLI](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/ci-cd/secrets/) as key-value pairs:

```bash
hasura3 secret set --project-id <PROJECT_ID_FROM_PREVIOUS_STEP> <KEY>=<VALUE>
```

And then reference the key in your `connection_uris` array:

```yaml
connectionUri:
  uri:
    stringValueFromSecret: <KEY>
```

## Introspect your data source

With our data source connected, the CLI can easily introspect it and generate metadata for us. This takes the
boilerplate tasks of creating types and relationships off your hands and lets you focus on the work that matters. With
just a couple of commands, we'll have our entire data layer defined and an API ready to go ðŸš€

The `hasura3 watch` command will watch your project directory for changes and automatically apply them to your Hasura
project. This is useful for development because it allows you to make changes to your project and see them reflected in
your Hasura project without having to manually apply them.

```bash
hasura3 watch --dir .
```

A daemon will start that will watch your project directory for changes. You can stop the daemon by pressing `Ctrl + C`.
**It's important to note: if you're using a tunnel, you'll need to kill that process before starting `hasura3 watch`, as
`watch` will take care of creating a tunnel for you.**

If you head to the `pg_db.hml` file in the `dataconnectors` directory, you'll see that the CLI has added information to
your metadata about the tables and views in your database ðŸŽ‰

Next, we'll create `hml` files for each of our tables and add them to the `models` directory in the `default` subgraph.
