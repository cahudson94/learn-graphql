After getting this page sorted, you'll be off to the races. This set of one-time setup steps will get you ready to start
building your Hasura project.

## Install the Hasura CLI {#hasura-cli}

We've redesigned the Hasura CLI from the ground up to make it easier to use and more powerful. Follow the
[install instructions from the docs](https://hasura.io/docs/3.0/cli/installation/) for your platform. **Please note,
this is a new CLI and is not the same as the previous version.**

## Install the VS Code extension {#vs-code-extensions}

We recommend using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and installing the Hasura VS Code extension. It allows you
to instantly scaffold out your metadata using the Open Data Domain Specification (OpenDD Spec) format ðŸš€

You can download the extension from the
[VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HasuraHQ.hasura).

## Authenticate your CLI {#cli-auth}

To authenticate your CLI to our network, run the following command:

```bash
hasura3 login
```

This will open a browser window where you can log in with your Hasura account. Once you've logged in, you can close the
browser window and return to your terminal.

## Download the Sample data {#sample-data}

Finally, you'll need the sample data we'll be using for this tutorial. We're using a PostgreSQL database for this
tutorial, and you can use the initial `up.sql` file to create the tables:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/docs-sample-app/main/migrations/default/1669033533483_init/up.sql -o up.sql
```

And then you can use the `tables_seed.sql` file to populate the tables with some sample data:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/docs-sample-app/main/seeds/default/tables_seed.sql -o tables_seed.sql
```

With Hasura, you can use either a hosted database or a local database.

If you're using a hosted database, use the files above to create the tables and seed data according to your provider's
instructions. If you're running a local PostgreSQL database ([such as with Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)),
create the tables and seeds and then start the database.
